                        <p>
                            I graduated high school with a degree in Maths and Science in Scheppers Institute Mechelen.
                            During high school I spend a good amount of my free time learning a couple of software basics.
                            I mostly wrote software in python, for several things like script and bots for a messasing platform.
                            I hosted these bots on a raspberry-pi so I also learned how to use linux and got accustomed to it.
                            My free time also had some creativity in it, I love to draw and be creative and as you can see, I designed my whole portfolio myself.

                        <p>
                            I am mostly interested in software, and design. I love writing software and I'm fond of creating.
                            I'm intrigued by the physchiology behind designs of websites, folders, other and how they can manipulate the consumer into doing the things you want them to do.
                            Music is also something I'm really interested in. I play the violin and find it an amazing break between studying or working.

                            I am a creative person that loves to learn and create. A quick learner is what I like to call myself. I seem to pick up things faster than others.
                            You could also say I'm somewhat of a perfectionist, but only in some ways. I like structure, in code, files and names for example.
                            I'm not a very outgoing person but I do feel that I can work good in a group if not even lead a group. Throughout my life I have worked together with other people and find myself taking the lead most of the time.

                            I'm currently studying electronics and ict at Thomas-More, with a bachelor in embedded software.
                            I learn how to write software for embedded systems like washing machines or cars.
                            I'm thinking about changing studies, I'm looking to do industrial engineering with a bachelor in electronics, at the university of KU-Leuven.
